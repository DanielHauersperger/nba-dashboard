        <h1>NBA Dashboard</h1>
        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>
        For my project I chose to build a dashboard to more conveniently stay up-to-date with NBA games and data. I did this because sometimes I don't have time to keep up with basketball, so when I do I want to be able to catch back up quickly. I built this as a proof of concept dashboard to show some of the most notable statuses such as rankings, recent game scores, etc., with functionality to dive deeper into relevant statistics when the user wants.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I built my dataset off of the NBA games dataset available on Kaggle, available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathanlauga/nba-games?select=games_details.csv">here</a> The dataset includes the following tables:

        <ul>
            <li>
            games.csv (21 columns): basic details on each game such as the date, teams playing, and points scored 
            </li>
            <li>
            games_details.csv (29 columns): detailed statistics on each player in each game, such as points scored, steals, blocks, and field goal percent. This dataset was too big to upload to GitHub, so I reduced it to just this year.
            </li>
            <li>
            players.csv (4 columns): name of each player and teams they played on each season
            </li>
            <li>
            ranking.csv (13 columns): ranking of each team on each day, including summary statistics of each teamâ€™s wins and losses so far. I chose to ignore this dataset, and instead calculated the rankings myself.
            </li>
            <li>
            teams.csv (14 columns): details on each team such as their coach, general manager, name, arena, and year they joined the NBA
            </li>
        </ul>
        To satisfy NBA.com's terms and conditions, I have not connected the dashboard to the live data, and have instead uploaded a static copy. This copy is from the Kaggle dataset's last refresh, with games as recent as March 12, 2022.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The rankings are always the most important thing for me to keep track of, so I made sure to prominently display them. Along with each ranking I included a bar chart of the point difference for each team's last ten games. For example, you can see that Utah has nine straight blue bars, so they are on a big losing streak.
        </p>

        <p>
        At the bottom I added a scrollable card with the most recent scores across the league. Clicking the accordion will open up detailed stats for the game. You can view game statistics aggregated at the team level, and you can also see each player's game stats.
        </p>

        <p>
        Since I'm interested in ways for diving deeper into the stats, I made the rankings interactive. When you click a team, the list of games is filtered to that team's games, and a table of each player's season statistics is created. I sorted by points per game so we can easily see the stats for each team's star players.
        I also included a line chart of each player's points in the last ten games. For example, here you can see Utah's star player Donovan Mitchell has been averaging 20 points, but this is trending downward.
        </p>

        <p>
        I used a similar color scheme as in my first project, since I felt the blue and gray provided sufficient visual contrast even for color-blind users, and I thought the colors felt consistent with the style of my bootstrap themes.
        </p>

        <p>
        My dashboard can be used to answer several questions about the current state and recent history of the NBA.
        For example, the question of "What is the current ranking of each team, and which ones are on a hot streak?" can be answered using my rankings view, which includes a small bar chart for viewing the recent performance of each team.
        Another possible question would be "Is Lebron James scoring well recently?" This question can be answered by viewing the sparkline to view the direction Lebron's scoring is trending, and the mean value in the sparkline graph can be compared against Lebron's season scoring mean. 
        A third question is "Who is the leading scorer for the Detroit Pistons this season?" This can be answered by clicking the Pistons in the rankings view, and viewing the top row of the player level statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
        My experiences with existing tools for viewing NBA statistics have left me frustrated, so I'm glad to have had the chance to try other ways for switching between different levels of detail and aggregation. There is definitely more progress to be made, but I'm happy with how I tied the views together, and I expect there are even more possibilities to make this feel more intuitive.
